                    America are not school ready when they enter kindergarten. Yet, children who get early literacy
                    exposure with positive speech interactions have a 32-million-word advantage by age four over
                    children who did not get this exposure. Teaching reading to preschoolers and being ready for

                                    as early as 3 or 4 months of age, during the brain's height of plasticity and synaptic
                                    formation. Such activities flex your child's mental muscles by feeding word traces into his

By giving your child opportunities to engage in listening, viewing, exploring and touching related to books and reading, it becomes a creative activity that engages both the creative and verbal sides of the brain. It also instills positive attitudes about books and jumpstarts the beginnings of a love for lifelong reading.<br><br>

Reading and being read to enables 2- and 3-year-olds to use complicated sentences, manage memory of distant events, build general knowledge, access new information, and develop powers of reflection. Reading stimulates language and vocabulary development, which is highly correlated with measures of intelligence. A 5-year-old reader acquires new knowledge from reading, while a 5-year-old nonreader can only admire the pictures.
